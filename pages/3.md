2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.
3. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla.
4. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.
5. Drop by rounded tablespoons onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.
6. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers are set.
7. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Here are some tips for making the best chocolate chip cookies:

- Use room temperature ingredients. This will help the cookies bake evenly and prevent them from becoming dry.
- Don't overmix the batter. Overmixing can make the cookies tough.
- Chill the dough for at least 30 minutes before baking. This will help the cookies hold their shape and prevent them from spreading too much.
- Bake the cookies until the edges are golden brown and the centers are set. Don't overbake them, or they will be dry.
- Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. This will help them set and prevent them from breaking.
