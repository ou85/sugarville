### Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, softened
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3 ripe bananas, mashed (about 1 1/2 cups)

Optional ingredients:

- 1/2 cup chopped nuts
- 1/2 cup chocolate chips
- 1/2 cup dried fruit
- 1/2 cup brown sugar (instead of granulated sugar)
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x5 inch loaf pan.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.
3. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla.
4. Add the mashed bananas to the butter mixture and beat until combined. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.
5. Stir in any optional ingredients.
6. Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
7. Let the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting it onto a wire rack to cool completely.

Enjoy!
