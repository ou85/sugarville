Once upon a time in the quirky town of Sugarville, there lived a baker named Max who had a peculiar problem: every cake he baked seemed to defy gravity. It all began when Max experimented with a new cake recipe that called for "extra lift." Not one to shy away from adventure, he followed the instructions diligently, but little did he know that the cake would take the term "rising" to a whole new level.

As Max opened the oven, the cake soared upward, straight through the kitchen ceiling, and into the clear blue sky. It was a cake that could rival any hot air balloon. Max spent his days chasing after cakes, often holding onto a string tied to their tails, as if participating in a whimsical cake parade. His bakery became famous not just for delicious cakes, but also for its daily "cake flights," much to the amusement of the townsfolk who gathered to witness Max's sweet and surreal escapades.
